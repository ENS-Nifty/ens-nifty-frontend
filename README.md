# ENS Nifty Wrapper
---
## Tokenize your ENS domain and trade it as an NFT

By wrapping your ENS deed in an Non-Fungible Token (NFT) you can take advantage of the developing ecosystem of marketplaces and auctions which support the new [ERC-721](https://erc721.org) crypto-collectible standard.


### Step 1: Transfer Ownership 🔀

This step transfers ownership of your deed to our [ENSNFT contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0xb52511f49f3ed76ad1f77998985ee452f29ba0fd)—don't worry you can get it back anytime!

## Step 2: Mint Your Token 💰

This step mints a new NFT token representing the ENS deed.

## Step 3: Enter the NFT Ecosystem 🌐

Take advantage of marketplaces like [opensea.io](https://opensea.io) and [rarebits.io](https://rarebits.io/) or communities like [tokntalk.club](http://tokntalk.club/).
